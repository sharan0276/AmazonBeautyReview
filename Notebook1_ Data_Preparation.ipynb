The hair had highlights in it and when I washed it there was a brown color in th water... this leads me to believe that the hair was dyed. And dyed hair is NOT virgin. Still after that the hair was shiny but the highlights and the dark brownish tint were bothering me so I dyed the hair black with the adore semi permanent hair color. It worked wonderfully but you do have to find a way to heat the hair so it will work. What I did was put the hair in a grocery bag twice and placed it in boiling water. The color took well. The last time I dyed hair with the adore color it didn\\u2019t work at all because I didn\\u2019t heat treat it. Closure might be too thin to cover the tracks but I think I\\u2019m just being nervous because the last set of hair I order from another company was terrible and wasn\\u2019t full enough. Also the closure seems to be a little drier! I\\u2019ll install the hair this weekend and give an update!<br /><br />UPDATE<br />The closure hair is sooo dry and is tangling a lot when I sleep. The bundles are decent. It\\u2019s kind of manageable but I would have been more care free if it wouldn\\u2019t tangle. I\\u2019ll install the hair again once or twice but with another closure probably from this listing so the waves are the same. The hair was tangle free for about 2 weeks. It does looking beautiful but the shedding!\",\n          \"I really love this hair. It's attractive choice and look for me. It feels good, good quality and manageable.
