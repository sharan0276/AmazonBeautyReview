Though the model with cv had executed in lesser time (1.47s) in comparison to XGBoost with cv (~ 4 s), cross validation ensures that the model does not fall into risk of overfitting on the data making it difficult for it to generalize when it runs on a new set of data.

What did you learn?\n","b. Did you find any pattern in your models/data?\n","c. Provide few key points that you learned from your results.\n","\n","\n","\n","a. From this project I learnt that data preparation also involves steps to understand the data and add relevant features that could be essential to predict success outcomes. having Domain knowledge helps with Imputation of values and EDA , where I understood not all outliers are bad and need to be removed. Sometimes, outliers help the model to classify good products from failed ones. Even when overfitting is not the case, a simple success metric can be figured out by complex classification models like Random Forest and XGBoost very easily, while ensuring that features that have good feature importance should be passed to models, it should also be judicious with the features that are passed ensuring no strong overall predictors are passed to models based on which models leverage a couple of features to classify labels. I also learnt that investing a good amount of time in feature engineering can assist with higher prediction accuracies for model, however the limit of feature engineering needs to be considered such that dataset is oversimplified for model to pick up on certain key features to predict success.\n","\n","b. I found that momentum based temporal patterns had a strong feature importance and at the same time were highly collinear with each feature. While building features it is equally important to test if features represent almost identical information instead of leaving it for later in the pipeline. Feature Selection is an iterative process that involves checking for collinearity, weak features exploring if features belonging to different data types share some similarities in values. Eventhough models suggest to drop features that are collinear it is always better to manually check if features that are going to be dropped are essential and statistically significant, similar to removing early_momentum_pct from features that were to be drop on collinearity basis. That was a feature that was statistically significant, dropping it woudl have costed the dataset from losing all review momentum related features because they shared collinearity with rating features that had greater importance in the dataset.\n","\n","\n","c.

By prioritizing business-driven thresholds and prediction based on early market acceptance indicators, the model delivers actionable early insights, assisting stakeholders with proactive marketing and inventory decisions.\n","\n","While the results from pre-tuned model is promising, there are several limitations that does provide opportunities for future improvement and broader applicability:\n","\n","1.\tClass Imbalance: The dataset had a significant data imbalance, with only 5.9% of products classified as successful. This constraint explains the limited precision in pre-tuned model. Exploring appropriate resampling techniques to mitigate the imbalance, could help improve on precision and recall of pre-tuned model to match tuned model scores.\n","\n","2.\tTemporal Window: The 28-day observation window captures early momentum effectively but may overlook products that might gradually gain popularity later. Studying to expand the observation window or retraining the model after a certain time threshold could help it understand nuances in the customer purchases and adapt accordingly.\n","\n","\n","3.\tSuccess Definition: The currently defined two tier success definition simplifies the success definition, which has been captured by model easily explaining the higher accuracy scores when trained on the entire 90-day window dataset. Could consider alternate multi-tier success definition to better capture successful products from all available products in the dataset.\n","\n","4.

Fig. 4 highlights that most values in store-encoding is 0 (about 100,000+ products), classified as “store_Unknown”. A further study into brand reputations and isolating those brands that have successful and unsuccessful effects among the customer based would be helpful to increase the coverage of brand reputation above 2% of dataset and incorporate reputation signals into training the model.
